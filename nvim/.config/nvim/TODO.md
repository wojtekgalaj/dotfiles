# Use Treesitter for documentation generation
I have mini.doc active but it's not very convincing. To be fair, I haven't put much effort into understanding how exactly it works.

It seems Treesitter would really be one of the best possible choices for the job, seeing how it has all the code broken down and knows exactly which part represents what.
